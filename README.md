HRMS Frontend project. (You can access the backend [here](https://github.com/MrPand-21/HRMS_Backend) and use them together to work with real database and backend)

### UML Component Diagram

![UML Component Diagram](../Diagram.png)

## Installation

To get this project you can run the following comments in your terminal which is opened in the folder where you want to copy to.

```bash
# clones the selected repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MrPand-21/HRMS_Frontend
```

After opened the project in the terminal, you can write

``` bash
# installs the dependencies
$ npm i
```

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash 
# runs the app in the development mode.
$ npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash 
# lunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
$ npm test
```

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```bash 
# builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
$ npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```bash 
#you may want to omit "eject"
$ npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
